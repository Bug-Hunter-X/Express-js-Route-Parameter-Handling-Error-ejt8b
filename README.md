# Express.js Route Parameter Handling Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route parameter handling and its solution.

## Bug Description
The code attempts to access `req.params.id` directly without properly validating if it exists or is of the expected type. This can lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes if the parameter is missing or contains unexpected data.

## Bug
The file `bug.js` contains the buggy code. The route `/users/:id` attempts to fetch a user from the database based on the `id` parameter. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the `id` parameter is missing or invalid. 

## Solution
The file `bugSolution.js` presents a solution to the bug. It adds error handling to check for the existence of the `id` parameter and its type before attempting to use it.
